# Analyzing-Thanksgiving-Dinner

In this project, I'll be working with Jupyter notebook, and analyzing data on Thanksgiving dinner in the US.

The dataset comes from [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/), and can be found [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/thanksgiving-2015).
